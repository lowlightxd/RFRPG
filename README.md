# RFRPG
Random Fischer-Random position generator

# What is it?
This piece of code generates a random legal position for a starting position in the game of Chess. 
But not regular Chess, cause it would be the same one every time, but rather - Fischer-Random chess,
where each piece is shuffled randomly on the backrow for both players, with both rooks being on the opposite sides of the king, and bishops being both colors.
This way the pure essence of chess remains intact, every game is different, and no soulless theory memorization!

# What is FEN?
FEN is a special notation used to describe the position in Chess.
